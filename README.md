Yelp Camp 

Welcome to Yelp Camp! 
Have you ever wanted to go camping, but didn't know where to look for a good campsite? Perhaps you've been camping all over and you'd like to share your experience
with others? Well look no further! Yelp Camp is exactly what it sounds like, Yelp for Camps. Here you'll be able to explore previously posted campgrounds, create your
own, or leave reviews of campgrounds you've visited. 
This is not a booking system. This site cannot make reservations or check for availability. This is more of a campground hub for locations and reviews where you can get
firsthand accounts of how people felt about their stay and what they experienced. 
Try it out! An account is required, so please log in and start perusing, creating and reviewing. 

This ambitious project utilized the following tech stack:
Javascript, CSS, EJS, Express, Node, Passport, MongoDB, Mongoose, Mongo Atlas, Cloudinary, Heroku, Helmet, and MapBox.  

This site was created in conjunction with the Web Development Bootcamp 2022 course through Udemy by Colt Steele.
